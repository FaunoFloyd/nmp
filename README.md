# NMP - Network Management Portal v1.0


A versatile and interactive command-line toolkit for network diagnostics. Designed for network administrators and support engineers, NMP provides a suite of essential tools to troubleshoot network issues on both Windows and Linux systems.

## ‚ú® Features

NMP wraps powerful command-line tools into a single, user-friendly script, making network diagnostics faster and more efficient.

- **Cross-Platform:** Fully functional on both **Windows** and **Linux** operating systems.
- **Interactive Menu:** An easy-to-navigate menu to select the right tool for the job.
- **Automated Tool Installation:** Automatically prompts to install missing dependencies like Nmap, Nping, and Curl on Linux.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Saves the output of every test to a timestamped log file on your desktop for easy review.
- **Cross-Platform Tools Suite:**
    - **Nmap & Nping:** For advanced port scanning and packet crafting.
    - **Curl:** For detailed HTTP/S analysis, including header checks, port connectivity, and latency timing.
    - **PCAP Capture:** Captures network traffic to a `.pcap` file for deep-dive analysis in tools like Wireshark.
    - **MTU Discovery:** Automatically determines the optimal Maximum Transmission Unit for a network path to diagnose fragmentation issues.
    - **Netstat:** Displays all active network connections and listening ports.
    - **Full Diagnostic:** Runs a comprehensive suite of tests against a single target for a complete network health check.
